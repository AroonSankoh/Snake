# Snake

In this project, I re-create Google's classic game "Snake" in Java using a LinkedList implentation. All the relevant code for the game mechanics can be found within the src folder, with each seperate mechanic in its own class file. Running the MainGame file will start the game! 

If you would like to play the original version, you can [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+snake&oq=google+snake&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j0i131i433i512l2j0i512j0i131i433i512j0i512j0i131i433i512j69i60.1120j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 

Thanks!
